## Guide

Create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred and is the simplest initial setup for learning.

1. To get started, set your `publishableKey` and `environmentId` in `public/index.html`.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Then, run `npm start` in your terminal to start the server.
4. Head to your `localhost` url output in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:1234`) and click the "Create new Space" button. You'll see a new Space get created. It contains a Workbook and a simple data hook validation.
5. Upload a file (an example file `getting-started.csv` can be found in of this project) or manually enter some data.
